# andriod-debugging-challenges

Lab submission for android debugging challenges. Note that, while I found three bugs in the code, I could not get the fourth program to run. One bug was with the API key, one was a bug with the name of an API JSON object being original-title instead of original_title, while the other was with the movie length method.
